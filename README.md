omgwallet
=========

omgwallet is a daemon handling Omega wallet functionality for a
single user.  It acts as both an RPC client to omgd and an RPC server
for wallet clients and legacy RPC applications. It is based on btcwallet
with some changes necessary to accomondate new Omega chain features, such
as typed token, geometry objects, etc. Everything else is pretty much
the same as btcwallet. Therefore, please refer [btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet/blob/master/README.md)
for more detail.
